# Queue Semantics & Model Streaming

## Queue Semantics

`aci-taskqueue` is the execution authority. The graph never decides which task is
next locally; it calls `claim_next`, which uses a SQLite `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
transaction to claim the highest-priority pending task across MCP subprocesses.

Human edits are hard state changes. Queue API writes update the same task store
that agents claim from, so an analyst priority change or dismissal affects the
next claim boundary.

Completion is queue-driven. A model response does not finish a run by itself; it
only completes the current task. The graph returns to `claim` until the queue is
empty, cancellation is requested, or step/tool-call budgets are exhausted.

The task lifecycle beyond claiming — the completion contract, per-task self-review,
and the seeder agent that populates the queue — is covered under
[Runtime & Agent Graph](agent-graph.md#task-completion-contract).

## Live Model Streaming

Model calls use LangChain streaming when the provider supports `astream`.
`agent.runtime.streaming.invoke_streaming` emits each provider text delta as a
`stream` event while accumulating the final `AIMessageChunk` so existing
tool-call and assessment logic still receives a normal final model message.

Transient deltas bypass the `AgentEvent` database writer. The runner appends them
to a thread-safe per-session buffer, and `RunConsumer` drains that buffer every
50 ms from the ASGI event loop before forwarding the deltas over WebSocket.

`static/dashboard/app.js` merges consecutive stream deltas from the same
source/run into a single live assistant bubble. When the orchestrator emits the
final persisted `answer` event, the browser finalizes that bubble instead of
rendering a duplicate answer.

Tool-call chunks are preserved by LangChain chunk addition. Chunks without text
still contribute to the accumulated final message but do not create visible
stream events.
